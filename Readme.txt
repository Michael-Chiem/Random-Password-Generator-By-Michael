Welcome to Michael Chiem "Random Password Generator" program.

First thing I created is variables.
    - characterLength = 8
    - choiceArray []; (Value zero)
    - specialCharacterArray []
    - lowerCaseCharacterArray []
    - upperCaseCharacterArray []
    - numberCharacterArray []

Next step is to create a function for a prompt
    - I used a parameter call "Not-A-Number" (NaN). To alert user is they are inputing the wrong value.
    - To test my codes, I inpected it and in the console, I typed "popUpScreen();" to see if the prompt is working, in this case, it's working as expected.
